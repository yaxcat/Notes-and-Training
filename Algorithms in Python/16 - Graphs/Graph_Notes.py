# GRAPH TERMINOLOGY
#   1) Vertices - nodes of the graph
#   2) Edge - line that connects pairs of vertices
#   3) Unweighted graph - a graph in which all edges have the same value
#   4) Weighted graph - a graph in which the values associated with edges differ
#   5) Undirected graph - a graph in which the edges do not have a direction associated with them
#   6) Directed graph - edges have a direction associated with them
#   7) Cyclic graph - a graph which contains at least one loop
#       - A collection of nodes and edges arranged such that they can be transited completely while traversing back to
#       - to the starting point
#   8) Acyclic graph - graph with no loops
#   9) Tree - a special case of a directed and acyclic graph



# GRAPH TYPES

#   1) Unweighted Undirected 
#   2) Unweighted Directed - Can be bidirectional or unidirectional
#   3) Positive Weighted Undirected - weights are positive numbers
#   4) Positive Weighted Directed
#   5) Negative Weighted Undirected - weights can be both positive and negative numbers
#   6) Negative Weighted Directed

# GRAPH REPRESENTATION

#   1) Adjacency Matrix - 2D array equal to the size of the nuumber of nodes **2.  Elements in the matrix indicate whether the pairs
#      of vertices share an edge or not (are adjacent).  See graphic
