# First Common Ancestor

# First Common Ancestor - LeetCode 236
# Design an algorithm and write code to find the first common ancestor of two nodes in 
# a binary tree. Avoid storing additional nodes in a data structure. NOTE: This is not 
# necessarily a binary search tree.

class Node:
    def __init__(self, value, left=None, right=None):

    # right and left subtrees

    # the root (same side of the tree).  The choice of left vs. right is arbitrary.  Either
    # will work here.

    # and b is false, it will return false if a and b are both true.  This is what we want
    # because in the event that both our target nodes are on the same side of the tree, we
    # want to run the function recursively, but if one target is on the left and the other is
    # on the right, we need to return their parent (root) node because we've found what we're
    # looking for
