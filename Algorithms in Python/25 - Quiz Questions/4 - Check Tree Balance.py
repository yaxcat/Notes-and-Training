# Balanced Tree

# Check Balanced - LeetCode 110
# Implement a function to check if a binary tree is balanced. For the purposes of this question, a balanced 
# tree is defined to be a tree such that the heights of the two subtrees of any node never differ by more than one.

# My Solution
# ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
# Code passed the test, but probably isn't a great solution since the way I implemented the getLeftHeight and 
# getRightHeight functions means that I'll only get the heights of the outermost left and right boundary branches.
# there could be unblanced branches in the middle of the tree which this algorithm would miss.

# Instructor Solution

# He creates a helper function as well.  It recurisvely calculates the left and right height of the as long as the 
# tree is balanced.  In the event an unbalanced branch is identified, it exits.  The helper function does not suffer
# the same drawbacks as the prior solution because it is recursively called on both the left and right subtrees,
# ensuring that all the intermediate root nodes are visited and all interior branches are traversed.

def isBalancedHelper(root):
    # base case.  Hit the end of the tree where there are no nodes, so return 0
    if root is None: 
        return 0
    
    # Recursively visit every node in the tree and tabulate the height.  We can exit early if a disbalance is encountered
    leftHeight = isBalancedHelper(root.left)
    if leftHeight == -1:
        return -1
    rightHeight = isBalancedHelper(root.right)

        return -1
    if abs(leftHeight-rightHeight) > 1: # Disbalance encountered

    return max(leftHeight, rightHeight) + 1 # Return the greater height, add one since each time we've hit a new node
