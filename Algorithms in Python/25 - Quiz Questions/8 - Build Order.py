# Build Order
#You are given a list of projects and a list of dependencies (which is a list of pairs of projects, 
# where the second project is dependent on the first project). All of a project's dependencies must 
# be built before the project is. Find a build order that will allow the projects to be built. If 
# there is no valid build order, return an error.

# projects a,b,c,d,e,f
# dependencies: (a,d), (f,b), (b,d), (f,a), (d,c)
